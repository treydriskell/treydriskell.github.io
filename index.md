### Hi, I’m Trey Driskell.

I recently earned my doctorate from USC, and I'm looking to break into the tech industry. My research involved building software to efficiently model new physics, extract insight from telescope data, and uncover novel phenomena using machine learning algorithms. This website is a work-in-progress, so please check-in regularly for updates!
