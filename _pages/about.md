Hi, my name is Trey Driskell, and I recently received my doctorate in Physics from the University of Southern California (USC). My thesis was on the formation of the first galaxies in our universe during the epoch known as Cosmic Dawn, advised by Vera Gluscevic. I worked on a variety of projects during the course of my degree, with a focus on numerical and statistical modeling of the global 21-cm signal observed by EDGES and SARAS experiments and early galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope.
