title: "Statistical Analysis of the First Galaxies"
---

Summary: I led one of the first statistical analyses of the oldest galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This was the first *Bayesian likelihood analysis* of this galaxy population using semi-analytic galaxy formation modeling. We made significant improvements in our likelihood modeling including *goodness-of-fit* tests (KS and $\chi^{2}$) not previously considered in the literature. 


The paper is currently in the process of peer-review, but you can see the [pre-print on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11680) for more details.
