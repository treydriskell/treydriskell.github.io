title: "Statistical Analysis of the First Galaxies"
---

Summary: I led one of the first statistical analyses of the oldest galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This was the first *Bayesian likelihood analysis* of this galaxy population using semi-analytic galaxy formation modeling. We made significant improvements to how the field approached modeling the data allowing us to extract astrophysical insight with confidence. 


The paper is currently in the process of peer-review, but you can see the [pre-print on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11680) for more details.
