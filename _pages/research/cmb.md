title: "Deep Convolutional Learning CMB Delensing"
---

Summary: I led a project that trained a *deep convolutional network* (ResUNet arch.) to learn an *image-to-image* mapping to delens Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) images. I built custom ResUNet architecture in PyTorch and evaluated it against a pre-trained model. We used CircleCI to automate CI/CD in GitHub. Paper published in [Physical Review D.](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.043518) and the open access preprint is available on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07391).

Below are some key figures from the paper:
